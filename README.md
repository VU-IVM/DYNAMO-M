# DYNAMO-M-v0.0
This repository contains the code applied in the first version of the DYNamic Adaptation Model + Migration. It simulates household adaptation and migration decisions under sea level rise and coastal population growth. The model simulates these dynamics by coupling an agent based model to a gravity model of migration (a figure of the model setup is shown below). The repository will be updated following release of future model versions.
