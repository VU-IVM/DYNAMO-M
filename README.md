# DYNAMO-M
This repository contains the code applied in the first version of the DYNamic Adaptation MOdel + Migration (DYNAMO-M). It simulates household adaptation and migration decisions under sea level rise considering various household characteristics. The model is a coupled agent based- gravity model, an overview of the model setup is shown below. The data required to run the model is currently not included, but it can be obtained through the original sources described in the [research paper]. The repository will be updated following the releases of future model versions.
